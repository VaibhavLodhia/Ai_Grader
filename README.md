Demo Prompts for given Grading.pdf assignment:

Solution of question 1.
```
print("The program prints a string in a reverse order.")
 in_string = input("Please enter a string: ")
 print()
 print("You typed a string:", in_string)
 print("The string in the reverse order: ", end ='')
 for i in range(len(in_string)):
       print(in_string[-i -1], end ='')
main() ```⁠

Solution of question 2:
```⁠
 def ToDigits(n, arr):	
	if (n == 0)
	digit = n % 10
	n = n // 10
	ToDigits(n, arr
	print(arr[digit] , end = " ")
arr = [ "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine" ]
n = 123 
ToDigits(n, arr)```
